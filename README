These are an experimental set of stylesheets to generate LaTeX from a custom
XML format for specifying software requirements.

Usage
=====

1) Author software requirements in an XML document (1). For an example XML 
   input, please see 'example/reqs.xml'.

2) Use (1) to generate a LaTeX file that only contains bindings:

  $ cd example (*)
  $ xsltproc ../xsl/bindings.xsl reqs.xml >reqs-bindings.tex

3) Use (1) to generate LaTeX source:

  $ xsltproc ../xsl/srstex.xsl reqs.xml >reqs.tex

4) Include 'reqs-bindings.tex' in LaTeX preamble.

5) Include 'reqs.tex' where you want the list of your requirements
   to appear.

(*) There's also a Makefile under the 'example' directory that captures 
    the above tasks. Simply type 'make' under the 'example' directory.

Notes
-----
1) Requirement identifiers must all be prefixed with 'r' e.g.:

  <req xml:id="rLunchRocket">
  ...
  </req>
