This project helps you *specify software requirements* in a high-level 
*XML* format and *generates LaTeX* markup that can be included in a host 
LaTeX document.

Usage
=====

1) Author software requirements in an XML document (1). A sample XML input
   can be found at: 'example/reqs.xml'

   This project defines a grammar for specifying software requirements in XML
   -see 'schema/rng'. Using a RelaxNG-aware XML editor (e.g. Emacs nXML-mode) 
   can make XML authoring of requirements very easy.

2) Use (1) to generate a LaTeX file that only contains LaTeX bindings:

  $ cd example # (*)
  $ xsltproc ../xsl/bindings.xsl reqs.xml >reqs-bindings.tex

3) Use (1) to generate LaTeX markup that corresponds to the specified 
   requirements:

  $ xsltproc ../xsl/srstex.xsl reqs.xml >reqs.tex

4) Include 'reqs-bindings.tex' in preamble of the host LaTeX document.

5) Include 'reqs.tex' where you want the list of your requirements
   to appear in the host LaTeX document.

   Index entries are automatically generated for the specified requirements 
   based on different criteria e.g. priority and development and resolution
   statuses. Make sure to use the \makeindex command in the host document
   in order for LaTeX to typeset the generated index entries.

(*) There's also a Makefile under the 'example' directory that captures 
    the above tasks. Simply type 'make' under the 'example' directory and
    press Return.

Notes
-----
1) Requirement identifiers must be prefixed with the value of the
   'req.idn.input.prefix' parameter defined in xsl/params.xsl.

  The 'req.idn.input.prefix' parameter is set to 'r' by default.

  An example of what requirement identifiers could look like:

    <req xml:id="rLunchRocket"> ... </req>
